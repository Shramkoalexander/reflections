When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use remote repo when I work with other developers so they can add new 
features to my project edit It and so on



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually because when I am working with other developers
they may push some commits that doesn't make sense for me now because 
the whole feature may be not ready yet
