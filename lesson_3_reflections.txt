When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use remote repo when I work with other developers so they can add new 
features to my project edit It and so on



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually because when I am working with other developers
they may push some commits that doesn't make sense for me now because 
the whole feature may be not ready yet



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- You should use Clone, when you have repo in your GitHub account and want to work with it on you computer
- You should use Fork, when you want work with repo which have been created by another developer so you Fork it,
 in other words clone it to your account on GitHub.
- You should use branch when you want to try new feature in your project or when you work with other people,
 that have access to your project
 
 
 
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 
 It helps to see last synchronization with remote repository and whether you need 
 to do git push to stay up-to-date
 
 
 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
 and what would be harder?
 
 It would be a nightmare without git and GitHub. 
 One thing would be easier without Git/GitHub you don't need to commit every change
 
 
 
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

I would want to make changes in a separete branch when I am working with other people 
or when I want to try new features but doing all the work in the master branch requires less actions
